What do we want the app to do?
    1) Opening screen --> A menu with a small login buton on the top right.
        Cart top right
    2) View the menu
    3) Make an order
    4) Add items to cart
    5) Display nutritional values on click
    6) Destination time for delivery
    
Getting Location:
    Yes. On opening of the app we will request for their locations to be 
    enabled. If they say no, they should still be able to look at the menu and 
    add items to cart. If they add items to cart and checkout without their 
    locations on or without getting their address from their accounts, we use a 
    dialog to open their locations must be turned out before checkout.
    
Time Calculation:
    The server can respond with a fake lat/long and then take the users location
    Or use google maps to calculate distance
